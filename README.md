#### Setting up a testing environment:
1. git pull https://github.com/joshuajz/BorgV2
2. Within that folder create a bot_token.txt (we currently just use a text file for the bot token)
3. Create a testing bot with the discord developer portal (https://discord.com/developers/applications)
4. Put the bot's token into bot_token.txt
5. Run main.py to get the bot up and running
